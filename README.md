## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: This project uses machine learning to classify Amazon product reviews into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocesses and cleans the data to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.

- **Model Training**: Trains a sentiment analysis model using a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Natural Language Processing).

- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of sentiment analysis results, making it easier to understand the data.
